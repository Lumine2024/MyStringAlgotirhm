This File is used to calculate numbers that will overflow int and long.

std::string str=MyAdd("1","2");//str="3"

std::string str2=MyAdd("99999999999999999999","1");//str2="100000000000000000000"

There are also calculation methods such as MyMinus, MyMultiply, MyDivide, MyPow, MyMod.

I sincerely hope this can help.
